[Proxy](images/proxy.png)

This is a repository which shows how to setup nginx reverse proxy to route requests to different servers.

We will use docker containers to demonstrate this.

It consists of three nginx servers.

## Steps to follow

- Run docker-compose up

```
docker-compose up
```

- Go to localhost:8080/

- This delivers the main app

- Go to localhost:8080/app/

- Reload the app and it redirects to app1 and app2
